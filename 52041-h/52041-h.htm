<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

<p>This short study was written during my tenure of a
Travelling Studentship from the National University of
Ireland, and in March, 1920, was accepted for the Research
Degree Certificate of Cambridge University.</p>

<p>A glance at the bibliography shows that comparatively
little has been written in English on this interesting period
of our history. On the other hand modern Scandinavian
scholars&mdash;Alexander Bugge, Marstrander, and Vogt&mdash;have
thrown a good deal of light on the subject, but unfortunately
very few of their books have been translated into English.
The present dissertation is based principally upon the Old
and Middle Irish annals and chronicles and the Icelandic
sagas; reference has also been made to the work of
Scandinavian, English and Irish scholars on the subject.</p>

<p>I should like to acknowledge my debt to Professor
Chadwick, who directed my work: those who have had the
privilege of working under him will readily understand how
much is due to his encouragement and stimulating criticism.
I wish also to express my thanks to my friends, Miss N.
Kershaw and Mr. E. J. Thomas, for many kindnesses while
the book was in preparation; to Miss Eleanor Hull and
Professor Ó’Máille, University College, Galway, for the
loan of books; and to the Librarian and staff of Cambridge
University Library, the National Library, Dublin, and
T.C.D. Library.</p>

<h1>Scandinavian Relations with Ireland
during the Viking Period.</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I"><span class="smaller">CHAPTER I.</span><br />
THE VIKINGS IN IRELAND (795-1014).</h2>

<p>The Vikings made their first appearance<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> on the Irish
coasts in 795 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, when they plundered and burned the
church on Recru, or Lambay Island, near Dublin. During
the next ten or twelve years Ireland seems to have been
almost free from further attacks, but in 807 they descended
on Inis Murray, off the Sligo coast, and from there made
their way inland to Roscommon.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> After that the raids
ceased for a few years, then began again with renewed
vigour on Connacht and Munster, on some of the inland
counties of Leinster, and on several places along the east
coast.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The arrival of Turgeis<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> (O.N. Thorgestr) in Armagh, about
832, marks a new phase of the invasions. Hitherto the
Vikings had come in isolated parties solely for purposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
of plunder; now, however, “great sea-cast floods of
foreigners” landed in every harbour, and began to form
settlements in various parts of the island. Dublin was first
occupied in 836, and four years later the Norsemen
strengthened their position there considerably by the erection
of a <i>longphort</i> or fortress. From their <i>longphort</i> at Linn
Duachaill (between Drogheda and Dundalk) built in the
same year, they made their way to the West and plundered
Clonmacnois, while settlers from Cael-uisce, near Newry,
went south and laid waste County Kildare.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The power of Turgeis was not confined to the north of
Ireland. His fleets were stationed on Loch Ree, the centre
from which Meath and Connacht were devastated. His
wife, Ota (O.N. Authr), desecrated the monastery of
Clonmacnois by giving her oracular responses (<i>a frecartha</i>)
from the high altar.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The tyranny of Turgeis came to an
end in 845, when he was captured by Maelsechnaill, who
afterwards became <i>árd-rí</i>, and was drowned in Lough Owel.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>After his death the tide of battle turned in favour of the
Irish, and the Norsemen were defeated in several battles.
Weakened by warfare, they had to contend in 849 with an
enemy from without&mdash;the Dubh-Gaill<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> or Danes who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
sailed round the south coast of England and landed in
Ireland “to exercise authority over the foreigners who
were there before them.” Two years after their arrival the
newcomers plundered the fortresses at Dublin and Dundalk,
but were attacked in the following year on Carlingford
Loch by the Norsemen. In this great naval battle, which
lasted three days and three nights, the Danes were finally
victorious.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>“Amhlaoibh Conung, son of the King of Lochlann,”
known in Icelandic sources as Olaf the White, came to
Ireland about 852 to rule over his countrymen, and to exact
tribute from the Irish.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> According to the <i>Fragments of
Annals</i>, he left suddenly and returned a few years later
accompanied by his “younger brother, Imhar,” who may
be identified with Ivarr Beinlausi (<i>i.e.</i>, “the Boneless”)
son of Ragnarr Lothbrók. Both kings ruled from Dublin,
which town now gained a new importance as the seat of
the Scandinavian Kings in Ireland. In 865 the Vikings
extended their activities to Scotland, whence they carried
off much plunder and many captives. An expedition on a
larger scale was made by Olaf and Ivarr in 869, when Dumbarton,
after a four months’ siege, fell into their hands.
They returned in triumph to Ireland in the following year
with a large number of English, British, and Pictish prisoners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and ended their victorious march by the capture of
Dunseverick (Co. Antrim).<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Olaf returned to Norway some time after this to take
part in the wars there,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and we hear no more of him in the
Irish Annals. “Imhar, King of the Norsemen of all Ireland
and Britain,” did not long survive him; his death is recorded
under the year 873.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>During the years which followed Ivarr’s death the country
was comparatively peaceful, and the Irish began to enjoy
a rest from fresh invasions, which lasted about forty years.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
The Danes and the Norsemen again began to quarrel among
themselves, and once more their opposing fleets met on
Carlingford Lough;<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> in this battle Albann (O.N. Halfdanr),
brother of Ivarr, a well-known leader of the Vikings in
England, was slain. Dissensions also spread among the
ranks of the Dublin Norsemen, dividing them into two
hostile parties, one siding with Sitriucc, son of Ivarr, the
other with a certain Sighfrith.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> This internal strife so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
weakened Norse power that the Irish captured the fortress
at Dublin in 902, and drove the Vikings across the sea
with great slaughter.</p>

<p>The forty years’ rest terminated abruptly in 913, when
several fleets arrived at Waterford and proceeded to ravage
all Munster and Leinster. In 916 Raghnall (O.N.
Rögnvaldr), grandson of Ivarr, assumed command while
his brother or cousin, Sihtric Gale (also nicknamed Caoch,
‘the Blind’) came with a fleet to Cenn Fuaid, in the east of
Leinster, and built a fortification there.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Both chiefs
united forces against the <i>árd-rí</i> Niall Glundubh, and having
defeated him in battle Sihtric entered Dublin and became
king (918). In the following year the Irish under Niall
made a brave stand at Kilmashogue, near Dublin, but
Sihtric won a decisive victory, and Niall and twelve other
kings were among the slain.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Scandinavian power in Ireland was now at its height.
Large fleets occupied all the lakes in Ulster, so that no
part of the surrounding territory was safe from their attacks.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
The Vikings also retained their grip of the coast towns, and
successfully withstood the efforts made by the Irish leaders
to dislodge them. Between the years 920 and 950 the
importance of Dublin increased considerably through its
connection with the Scandinavian Kingdom of Northumbria.
Raghnall, grandson of Ivarr, captured York about 919<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and
reigned there until his death in 921.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> He was succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
by Sihtric Gale, who had been expelled from Dublin in the
preceding year,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> probably by his brother, Guthfrith. After
Sihtric’s death in 927 Guthfrith, King of Dublin (d. 934),
with the Vikings of Dundalk, left Ireland in order to secure
his own succession in York, but he would seem to have
been driven out by Aethelstan, for the Irish Annals mention
his return to Dublin after an absence of six months.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Guthfrith’s son, Olaf, came forward about this time.
Supported by the Norsemen of Strangford Lough he
plundered Armagh, but his subsequent attacks on Ulster
were checked by Muirchertach MacNeill, son of Niall
Glundubh. Olaf fought in alliance with Constantine in the
battle of Brunanburh (937), and after the defeat inflicted
on them by Aethelstan’s forces he fled to Dublin.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> He is
probably the “Anlaf of Ireland” who was chosen King
by the Northumbrians in 941,<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> but he died about a year
later.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Another Olaf, the famous Olaf Cuaran, also called
Sihtricsson to distinguish between them, also played an
important part in campaigns in Ireland and England. He
went to York about 941, and was elected king by the
Northumbrians, but was expelled after a few years along
with Raegenald, son of Guthfrith.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> He then took the Dublin
Kingdom under his rule, and in the following year was
defeated in battle by the Irish at Slaine (Co. Meath). Leaving
his brother Guthfrith to govern in his stead, he departed
to York, where he became king a second time; but the
Northumbrians drove him out after three years and placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
“Yric, son of Harald” (<i>i.e.</i>, Eric Bloodaxe, late King of
Norway) on the throne.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Henceforward Olaf limited his activities to Ireland,
where he reigned, the most famous of the Dublin Kings,
for some thirty years. In 980, having summoned auxiliaries
from the Scottish isles and Man, he prepared to attack the
<i>árd-rí</i>, Maelsechnaill II. A fierce battle was fought between
them at Tara in which the Norse armies were completely
routed, Olaf’s son Raghnall being among the slain. Maelsechnaill
followed up this victory by a three days’ siege
of Dublin, after which he carried off a number of hostages
from the Norsemen, and also obtained from them 2,000
kine, together with jewels and various other treasures.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
Olaf himself, utterly disheartened by his defeat, went on
pilgrimage to Iona, where he died soon after.</p>

<p>Some fifteen years before, a severe blow had been struck
at the power of the Limerick Vikings under Ivarr, grandson
of Ivarr and his sons. The attack made on them at Sulcoit
(968) by two princes of the Dal Cais, the brothers
Mathgamain and Brian, resulted in victory for the Irish,
who took Limerick shortly after.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Mathgamain was
treacherously murdered in 976, and Brian then became
King of Thomond. He soon brought the Kingdoms of
Ossory and Leinster under his control, and by the terms
of a treaty made in 998 Maelsechnaill consented to leave
Brian master of Leth Mogha (<i>i.e.</i>, the southern half of
Ireland). The Leinstermen under King Maelmordha,
dissatisfied with this arrangement, began to make trouble
and revolted, assisted by the Dublin Norsemen. An important
victory was gained over their combined armies at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Gleann Mama (Co. Wicklow) in the year 1000 by Brian,
who after the battle captured Dublin. King Sihtric (O.N.
Sigtryggr), son of Olaf Cuaran, had to submit to Brian’s
authority. Having accepted his allegiance Brian married
Gormflaith, mother of Sihtric and sister of Maelmordha,
and at the same time gave his own daughter to Sihtric
in marriage.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Brian became <i>árd-rí</i> in 1002, and after that for about
twelve years there was peace. Towards the end of that
time Gormflaith, who had meanwhile separated from her
husband, incited her brother Maelmordha to make war on
Brian. Maelmordha and Sihtric began to gather forces for
the coming struggle. Sihtric at his mother’s command
sought the aid of Sigurthr, Earl of Orkney and of Brodar,<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
a Viking whose fleet then lay off the west coast of Man.
Fleets also came from Norway<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and Iceland to help their
kinsmen. The armies under Brian and Maelsechnaill
marched towards Dublin, and having encamped near
Kilmainham set fire to the district of Fingal (<i>i.e.</i>, <i>Fine Gall</i>,
“the Foreigners’ territory”) north of the city. The two
armies met at Clontarf on Good Friday morning and the
battle, one of the most famous ever fought on Irish soil,
raged all that day. The Norsemen suffered a severe defeat,
and in attempting to fly for refuge to their ships were
slaughtered by Maelsechnaill at Dubhgall’s Bridge, near

<p>After the Battle of Clontarf the Norsemen became
gradually absorbed in the general population except in a
few coast towns, where they continued to live more or
less distinct and governed by petty kings until the English
Invasion (1169). In the chronicles of the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries they are generally alluded to as
“<i>Ostmen</i>” (corruptly <i>Houstmanni</i>, <i>Nosmani</i>, etc.),<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and it
would seem that when Dublin, Limerick, and Waterford
were captured by the English the “Ostmen” had to withdraw
to certain districts outside the walls of these towns.
Thus, near Dublin, north of the River Liffey, we hear of
Ostmaneby<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> (<i>i.e.</i>, <i>Austmannabyr</i>) afterwards called Ostmanstonry,
and now known as Oxmanstown. Mention is also
made (c. 1200) of a “‘cantred’ of the Ostmen and holy
isle,” near Limerick and (c. 1282) of a “vill of the Ostmen”<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
near Waterford.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> In the records of the fourteenth century,
however, there is an almost total absence of references to
the “Ostmen” in Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Zimmer was of the opinion that the Norsemen made their way
to Ireland as early as the seventh century. He bases his theory
on an entry in the <i>Annals of Ulster</i> and in certain other Irish annals
(under the year 617) recording “the devastation of Tory Island
by a marine fleet.” (<i>über die frühesten Berührungen der Iren mit
den Nordgermanen</i>, p. 279 ff. in <i>Sitzungsberichte der kgl. preussischen
Akademie der Wissenschaften</i>. 1891. Bd. I., pp. 279-317.) But this
attack is likely to have been due to Saxon or Pictish raiders rather
than to the Norsemen.</p>

Fairhair, who with his brother Frothi went on a viking expedition
to Ireland. They captured Dublin, and Thorgils reigned there for
a long time as king. In the end, however, he was betrayed by the
Irish and was killed. (<i>Heimskringla: Haralds saga hins hárfagra</i>,
ch. 35.)
</p>
<p>
This account of Thorgils certainly bears a resemblance to that
of Turgeis contained in the Irish chronicles and Giraldus
Cambrensis (cf. Todd: Introduction to <i>War of the Gaedhil with
the Gaill</i>, I., ii.), but it is of course incorrect to say that Turgeis
was a son of Harold Fairhair.</p>

Vogt (<i>Dublin som Norsk By</i>, p. 66) suggests that Olaf was related
to Turgeis, the first Norse King of Ireland, and to Earl Tomrair
(O.N. Thórarr), “<i>tanist</i> of the King of Lochlann,” who fell in the
battle of Scaith Neachtain (847). On the other hand it may be noted
here that the Annalist errs in making Olaf a brother of Ivarr the
Boneless.</p>

The name “Ostmen” is generally supposed to have been first
given to them by the English, but the word is Norse (<i>i.e.</i>, <i>Austmenn</i>,
plural of <i>Austmathr</i>, “a man living in the East”) and therefore
must have been current in Ireland before the English invasion. It
may be suggested that the name was applied to the original
Scandinavian settlers in Ireland, to merchants and other later comers
from Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. Cf. the nickname <i>Austmathr</i>,
given to a certain Eyvindr by the Scandinavian settlers in the
Hebrides because he had come there from Sweden.</p>

INTERCOURSE BETWEEN THE GAILL AND
THE GAEDHIL DURING THE VIKING
PERIOD.</h2>

<p>The existence of the Gaill-Gaedhil or foreign Irish in Ulster
and various parts of Munster<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> during the years 854-856
shows that even in the early part of the ninth century
there must have been considerable intercourse between the
Vikings and the native population. For some of the Gaill-Gaedhil
were partly of Irish, partly of Norse extraction;
others, as the annalist explicitly states, were Irishmen who
had been fostered by the Norsemen, and in consequence
had forsaken Christian practices and lapsed into Paganism.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
From a chance allusion in a tenth century text<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> it
would seem that they could speak Gaelic, but so badly
that the expression “the gicgog of a Gall-Gaedheal” was
generally understood to mean halting or broken Gaelic.</p>

<p>They are mentioned in the Annals for the first time<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> in
854, in which year Aedh Finnliath, King of Aileach, won<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
a great victory over them in a battle fought at Glenelly,
in Tyrone.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> After this they took an active part in the
Irish wars, fighting like mercenaries on different sides&mdash;at
one time in alliance with the <i>árd-rí</i>, Maelsechnaill, who was
at war with the Norsemen;<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> again, with an Irish clan
against the Dublin Vikings under Ivarr,<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and still later we
find them joined with the men of Waterford in opposition
to the <i>árd-rí</i>.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Led by Caittil Find (O.N. Ketill + Ir. <i>find</i>&mdash;fair)
they made their last stand against the Dublin
Vikings under Olaf and Ivarr, but were defeated with heavy
losses, and after this there is no further record of their
activities in Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> On one occasion at least, they fought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
with the Viking armies in England. According to the account
of the siege of Chester (c. 912) preserved in the <i>Three
Fragments of Annals</i>, many Irishmen, foster-children of
the Norsemen, formed part of the besieging army under the
chieftain Hingamund,<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> who had been expelled from Dublin
some time previously. To these Irishmen Aethelflaed, the
lady of the Mercians, sent ambassadors appealing to them
as “true and faithful friends” to abandon the “hostile
race of Pagans” and to assist the Saxons in defending the
city. The Irish then deserted their former allies and joined
the Saxons, “and the reason they acted so towards the
Danes,” adds the chronicler, “was because they were less
friendly with them than with the Norsemen.”<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>The Vikings who formed settlements in Ireland during
the reign of Turgeis (839-845) seem to have mingled freely
with the Irish, for we find them not long after their arrival
stirring up the clans to rebellion against the <i>árd-rí</i><a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> and
joining the native princes on plundering expeditions. The
annals mention several such alliances. Cinaedh, Prince of
Cranachta-Breagh, who had revolted against Maelsechnaill
with a party of plunderers, laid waste the country from the
Shannon eastward to the sea.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Another Irish prince, Lorcan,
King of Meath, accompanied Olaf and Ivarr when they
broke into the famous burial-mounds<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> at New Grange,
Knowth and Dowth, on the Boyne, and carried off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
treasures which they found there. After the great naval
battle between Danes and Norsemen in Carlingford Lough
(<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 852) Danes and Irish frequently united forces against
the common enemy, and on one occasion&mdash;after the two
armies had won a victory over the Norsemen in Tipperary&mdash;the
Danish chieftain Horm and his men were escorted
in triumph to Tara where they were received with great
honour by the <i>árd-rí</i>.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Even after the arrival of Olaf the
White, who brought about a temporary reconciliation
between the two parties of “Foreigners,” a detachment
of Danes remained on in the service of Cearbhall, King
of Ossory.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>The Irish chronicler, in alluding to the Norse practice
of billeting their soldiers in the Irish farmhouses, lays stress
on the feelings of hostility entertained by the Irish towards
this “wrathful, foreign, purely Pagan people.” Yet, we
not infrequently find instances of friendly intercourse, as
in the well-known story of Olaf-Trygvason and the peasant.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
It appears that after Olaf’s marriage to Gyda, sister of
Olaf Cuaran, he occasionally visited Ireland. Once he sailed
there with a large naval force, and being short of provisions
went on land with his men on a foraging expedition. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
seized a large number of cows, and were driving them towards
the shore when a peasant ran after them and begged Olaf
to give him back his cows. Olaf told him to take them, if
he could separate them from the rest without delaying
their journey. The peasant had with him a large sheep-dog,
which he sent in among the herd, and the dog ran up
and down and drove off as many cows as the peasant
claimed. As they were all marked in the same way it was
evident that the dog knew all his master’s cows. Then Olaf
asked if the peasant would give him the dog. “Willingly,”
was the reply. So Olaf gave him in return a gold ring, and
assured him of his friendship. The dog was called Vígi,
“the best of all dogs,” and Olaf had it for a long time.
Years later, after the great naval battle in which Olaf lost
his life, “Vígi lay on a mound and would take no food
from anyone, although he drove away other dogs and beasts
and birds from what was brought to him… Thus he
lay till he died.”<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, the evidence of both Norse and Irish sources
goes to show that all through the ninth and tenth centuries
there was extensive intermarriage between the two peoples.
Marriages of the invaders with the women whom they
had carried off as captives must have taken place from an
early period,<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and we know definitely that the kings and
chieftains on both sides frequently strengthened their
alliances by unions between members of the royal families.
According to the <i>Landnámabók</i> many distinguished Icelanders
traced their descent to Kjarval, <i>i.e.</i>, Cearbhall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
King of Ossory (d. 887), an ally of Olaf and Ivarr. His
grandson, Dufthak (Ir. Dubhthach)<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> was the founder of an
Icelandic family, and three of his daughters, Kormlöth (Ir.
Gormflaith),<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Frithgerth<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and Rafarta<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> married Norsemen.
The <i>Landnámabók</i> speaks of Kjarval as having been King
of Dublin while “Alfred the Great ruled in England…
and Harold Fairhair in Norway,”<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> a statement which is
often doubted because unsupported by the evidence of the
Irish historians; but it is not at all unlikely, since Cearbhall
was remotely connected with the Dublin royal house through
his granddaughter Thurithr, who married Thorsteinn the
Red, son of Olaf the White.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>There is no mention of Authr, Olaf’s Norse wife, in the
Annals, but we hear incidentally<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> that Olaf, while in Ireland,
married a daughter of Aedh Finnliath, King of Aileach.
After he became <i>árd-rí</i> (864) Aedh turned against the
Norsemen, and having plundered all their fortresses in
the north of Ireland marched towards Lough Foyle, where
they had assembled to give him battle. Aedh was victorious,
and some years after he again defeated the Foreigners,
who were at this time in alliance with his nephew Flann;
Flann himself and Carlus, son of Olaf the White being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
numbered among the slain. We also hear of other Irish
Kings who were closely related to their Viking opponents.
<i>Laxdaela Saga</i> contains an interesting account of a slave-woman
who was bought at a market in Norway by an
Icelander called Höskuldr. The woman was dumb, but
Höskuldr was so struck by her appearance that he willingly
paid for her three times the price of an ordinary slave,
and took her back with him to Iceland. A few years later,
happening to overhear her talking to their little son, Olaf
Pái, he discovered to his amazement that her dumbness
was feigned. She then confessed that her name was
Melkorka (Ir. <i>Mael-Curcaigh</i>) and that she was the daughter
of Myr Kjartan, a king in Ireland, whence she had been
carried off as a prisoner of war when only fifteen years old.</p>

<p>When Olaf was grown up his mother urged him to visit
Ireland in order to establish his relationship with King
Myr Kjartan, “for,” she said, “I cannot bear your being
called the son of a slave-woman any longer.” Before they
parted she gave him a large finger-ring and said: “This
my father gave me for a teething-gift, and I know he will
recognise it when he sees it.” She also put into his hands
a knife and belt and bade him give them to her nurse: “I
am sure she will not doubt these tokens.” And still further
Melkorka spoke: “I have fitted you out from home as
best I know how, and taught you to speak Irish, so that it
will make no difference to you where you are brought to
shore in Ireland…”<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>The saga goes on to describe the voyage to Ireland, the
landing there, and Olaf’s reception by King Myr Kjartan.</p>

<p>Myr Kjartan may be identified with Muirchertach “of
the Leather Cloaks,” King of Aileach, who like his father
Niall Glundubh distinguished himself by his spirited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
resistance to Norse rule in the first half of the tenth century.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
Donnflaith, another of his daughters and mother of the
<i>árd-rí</i>, Maelsechnaill II., married Olaf Cuaran. Their son,
Gluniarainn, reigned in Dublin after his father’s retirement
to Iona, and appears to have been on friendly terms with
Maelsechnaill.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> The relationship between these two families
becomes more complicated owing to the fact that
Maelsechnaill’s own wife, Maelmuire (d. 1021), was a
daughter of Olaf.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>But perhaps no figure stands out so prominently in the
Irish and Norse chronicles<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> of the second half of the tenth
century as Gormflaith (O.N. Kormlöth) who first married
Olaf Cuaran, then his enemy Maelsechnaill II., and finally
Brian Borumha, from whom she also separated.</p>

<p>The interchange of family and personal names which took
place to such an extent during the Viking period also points
to the close connection between the foreigners and the
Irish. As early as 835 mention is made of one Gofraidh
(O.N. Guthröthr), son of Fergus, who went to Scotland from
Ireland in order to strengthen the Dal Riada and died some
time after as King of the Hebrides.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> The Dublin Viking
who led an attack on Armagh in 895 had an Irish name,
Glun-iarainn, obviously a translation of O.N. <i>Jarn-kné</i>.
He was in all probability a relative of Iercne or Jargna
(corrupt forms of <i>Jarn-kné</i>) who ruled in conjunction with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Zain or Stain (O.N. Steinn) as King of Dublin (c. 850);<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
while other earls of Dublin, Otir mac Eirgni,<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Eloir mac
Ergni or Largni<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> and Gluntradna, son of Glun-Iarainn
would also appear to have been of the same royal family.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
Irish names occur more frequently in Norse families during
the tenth and eleventh centuries; we find Uathmaran, son
of Earl Bairith (O.N. Barthr); Camman,<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> son of Olaf
Godfreyson; Giolla Padraig, Dubhcenn<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> and Donndubhan,
sons of King Ivarr of Limerick;<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Niall, son of Erulb (O.N.
Herjulfr); Cuallaidh, son of King Ivarr of Waterford;
Eachmarach, and very many others.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> On the other hand,
we may note the prevalence of such common Norse names
as Ivarr, Guthröthr, Sumarlithi among the Irish, especially
in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Several of these
names still survive, as, for instance, MacAuliffe (O.N.
Óláfr); MacCaffrey (O.N. Guthöthr); MacCalmont or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Lamont (O.N. Lögmathr); Kettle (O.N. Ketill); Kitterick
(? Ir. Mac + N. Sigtryggr); MacKeever (O.N. Ivarr);
Manus and MacManus (O.N. Magnus); Quistan (Ir. Mac. +
O.N. Eysteinn); Reynolds (O.N. Rögnvaldr); Sigerson
(O.N. Sigurthr) and MacSorley (O.N. Sumarlithi).</p>

<p>Both Gaill and Gaedhil, so dissimilar in many ways,
benefited by their intercourse with one another. In Ireland
the Vikings played an important part in the development
of trade; they also promoted the growth of town life. We
may trace the beginnings of the seaport towns, Dublin,
Limerick, Waterford and Wexford, to the forts built by
them near the large harbours in the ninth and tenth
centuries. In Dublin coins were minted for the first time
in Ireland<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> during the reign of Sihtric Silken Beard (c.
989-1042). Moreover, the large number of loan-words from
Old Norse which made their way into Irish shows that the
Irish learned in many other ways from the invaders, notably
in shipbuilding and navigation.</p>

<p>So far as literature and art are concerned, the period of
the Viking occupation is one of the most interesting in the
history of Ireland. In spite of the destruction of the
monasteries and the departure of numbers of the monks<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
to the Continent the work of the great schools was carried
on and there was considerable literary activity;<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> in 914
and 924, respectively, the great crosses at Clonmacnois
and Monasterboice were set up; cumhdachs, or book-shrines
of plated gold and silver, were made for the three great
manuscripts, the <i>Book of Kells</i>, the <i>Book of Durrow</i> and the
<i>Book of Armagh</i>; carved gold, silver, and bronze work
reached a high level of excellence in the famous Ardagh
Chalice and the Tara Brooch; and during the years which intervened
between the battles of Gleann Mama and Clontarf,
Romanesque architecture was introduced into Ireland.
Irish art did not remain wholly free from Scandinavian
influence. In the Cross of Cong (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1123) the Celtic interlaced
patterns are found side by side with the “worm-dragon”
ornament, while the crosier of Clonmacnois, the
psalter of Ricemarsh and the shrine of St. Patrick’s Bell
are decorated in the style known as “Hiberno-Danish.”<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>The Vikings, on the other hand, came under the influences
of Irish art and literature. We find marks of Celtic influence
not only in the sculptured crosses erected by the Norsemen
in the North of England and Man, but even in Scandinavia
itself.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Moreover, there are strong reasons for supposing
that the rise of the prose saga among the Icelanders may
be the outcome of their intercourse with the Irish in the
ninth and tenth centuries.</p>

large tracts of territory “after the manner of the Gentiles” (<i>Annals
of Ulster</i>, <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 845). The Annalists call them “sons of death” (<i>maic

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_48" id="Footnote_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> There was also a mixed Norse and Gaelic population in Galloway
(the word is a corruption of <i>Gall-Gaedhil</i>, Welsh Galwydel) as well as
in the Hebrides (Ir. <i>Innse Gall.</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the “Islands of the Foreigners or
Norsemen”) and other parts of Scotland. There is a reference to
these Gaill-Gaedhil in the <i>Four Masters</i> (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1154): “The Cinél
Eoghain and Muirchertach, son of Niall, sent persons over the sea
to hire the fleets of the Gaill-Gaedhil of Aran, Cantire and the Isle
of Man and the borders of Scotland in general, over which Mac
Sgelling was in command…” (For other references see
Marstrander, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 9.)
</p>
<p>
By <i>Gaddgethlar</i> the Norsemen understood “the place… where
Scotland and England meet” (cf. <i>Orkneyinga Saga</i>, ch. 28). It is also
interesting to note that in Norse sources the inhabitants of Galloway
are called <i>Vikinga-Skotar</i>, a direct translation of Gaill-Gaedhil.
</p>
<p>
O’Flaherty (<i>Ogygia</i>, p. 360) thought that the Gaill-Gaedhil
mentioned in the Annals of the mid-ninth century came to Ireland
from Scotland, but the ancient <i>Three Fragments of Annals</i>, which
contain the fullest accounts of the Gaill-Gaedhil (pp. 138-141) speak
of them as <i>Scuit</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, an Irish form of the Latin <i>Scoti</i>, a word which
is always used with reference to the Irish before the tenth century).
Moreover, the impression received from reading the <i>Fragments of
Annals</i> is that the Annalist had in his mind the Norse-Gaelic
population of Ireland, not of Scotland.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_53" id="Footnote_53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> The plundering of these burial-mounds&mdash;“a thing that had never
been done before”&mdash;made a deep impression on the Irish Annalists;
it was thought that the Vikings discovered the existence of the
treasure by magic, “through paganism and idol worship” (<i>War of
the Gaedhil with the Gaill</i>, p. 115). The same source (p. 25) records
the plundering of Kerry by Baraid (O.N. Barthr) and Olaf the White’s
son “who left not a cave there underground that they did not explore.”
</p>
<p>
Several references to this practice of the Vikings occur also in
Icelandic literature. It is interesting to compare the Irish accounts
with the following passage from Landnámabók (I., ch. 5): “Leifr
(one of the earliest settlers in Iceland) went on a Viking raid to the
West. He plundered Ireland and found there a large underground
house (Icel. <i>jarth-hus</i>). It was dark within until he made his way
to a place where he saw a light shining from a sword which a man
held in his hand. Leifr slew the man and took the sword and much
treasure besides.”</p>

THE GROWTH OF THE SEAPORT TOWNS.</h2>

<p>The foundation of the seaport towns was the most important,
and at the same time the most permanent effect of the
Viking invasion of Ireland. Before this the only towns
were the larger monastic centres<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> at Armagh, Clonmacnois,
Durrow and Clonfert, which, besides the monastery itself,
consisted of numerous beehive-shaped houses of stone, or
small huts of clay and wattles built for the accommodation
of the students attending the schools. During the first
half of the ninth century these monasteries suffered sorely
from the attacks of Viking raiders. After a stubborn
resistance on the part of the Irish, Armagh fell into the hands
of Turgeis, who drove out the abbot Farannan and “usurped
the abbacy” (c. <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 839). Some years later Armagh was
abandoned when the Vikings captured Dublin, at this time
a small “town by the hurdle ford,”<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> but they were quick
to realise its possibilities as the seat of their monarchy and
the chief centre of their trade. As a result of the struggle
for ecclesiastical supremacy, which took place at a later
period<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> between Armagh and Dublin, the Bishops of Dublin
were obliged to acknowledge the Primate of Armagh;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
but the latter town never recovered its former prestige as
the capital of Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>That Dublin owes its importance, if not its origin, to the
Norsemen may be inferred from the almost total silence of
the historians and annalists regarding it in the years preceding
the Scandinavian inroads. It is probable that there
was a fort to guard the hurdle-ford where the great road
from Tara to Wicklow, Arklow and Wexford crossed the
Liffey, but it seems to have played no great part in history
before the Norsemen fortified it in 840. Between Church
Lane and Suffolk Street they had their <i>Thing</i><a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> or meeting-place,
which was still to be seen in the seventeenth century;
while all along College Green, called Le Hogges<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> and later
Hoggen Green by the English, lay their barrows (O.N.
<i>haugar</i>). During the ninth and tenth centuries the Kingdom
of Dublin&mdash;known to the Scandinavians as <i>Dyflinarski</i>&mdash;became
one of the most powerful in the west. Its sway
extended north to its colonies<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> at the Strangford and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Carlingford Loughs, west to Leixlip, south to Wicklow,
Wexford<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> and even as far as Waterford. The Dublin kings
intermarried with royal families in Ireland, England and
Scotland, and between the years 919 and 950 ruled, though
in somewhat broken succession, as Kings of York.</p>

<p>Limerick (O.N. Hlymrek)<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>, the great stronghold on the
west coast, had no existence as a city before the ninth
century. It was first occupied during the reign of Turgeis
by Vikings, who used the harbour as a base for their ships.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
The only chieftains mentioned in connection with this
kingdom during the ninth century are Hona and Tomrir
Torra (O.N. Thórarr Thórri), who were slain about the
year 860 in attempting to capture Waterford.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> A few years
later Barith (O.N. Barthr) and Haimar (O.N. Heimarr)
when marching through Connacht on their way to Limerick,
were attacked by the Connachtmen and forced to retreat.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
The real importance of Limerick, however, dates from the
early part of the tenth century when it was colonised by
Vikings under Tomar (Thórir) son of Elgi (O.N. Helgi).
To secure the fort against attack an earthen mound was
built all round, and gates were placed at certain distances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
leading into the streets and the houses.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> As a kingdom it
was independent, having subject colonies at Cashel, Thurles,
Lough Ree and Lough Corrib.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> It had no connection with
Dublin during the tenth century; in fact, there is evidence
to show that both royal houses were bitterly hostile towards
each another. On one occasion Guthfrith, King of Dublin,
led an army to Limerick, but was repulsed with heavy losses
by the Vikings there.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> A few years later (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 929) he
expelled Tomar’s successor, King Ivarr of Limerick, and his
followers from Magh Roighne (a plain in Ossory), where
they had encamped for a whole year. Olaf Godfreyson
was equally active. After defeating Olaf Cenncairech and
the Limerick Vikings at Lough Ree in 937, he carried them
off to Dublin,<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> and that same year probably forced them
to fight on his side in the battle of Brunnanburh.</p>

<p>This hostility would seem to have been due to rivalry
between two powerful kingdoms, rather than, as has been
suggested,<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> to difference of nationality. It is not at all
certain that the Limerick Vikings were purely Danes.
One Irish chronicler speaks of the Scandinavians in Munster
as <i>Gaill</i> and <i>Danair</i> and calls their fleets <i>loingeas
Danmarcach ocus allmurach</i> (“fleets of Danes and
foreigners”).<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> we find the word Lochlannaigh
(<i>i.e.</i>, Norsemen) used with reference to the Limerick settlers;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and Colla (O.N. Kolli), Prince of Limerick (d. 931) was
certainly a Norseman, for he was son of Barthr, a leader
of the Finn-Gennti in the ninth century. There would seem
to have been a mixture of both Danes and Norsemen in
Limerick, and since there is no proof that struggles for
mastery took place between them, we may take it that they
acted in harmony.</p>

<p>During the tenth century Limerick stood in close
connection with the Scandinavian Kingdom in the Hebrides.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
Mention is made of one chieftain “Morann, son of the
Sea King of Lewis,”<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> who fought and fell in Limerick
against the Irish. Moreover, the occurrence of the names
Manus, Maccus (O.N. Magnus) and Somarlidh (O.N.
Sumarlithi) in both royal families points at least to relationship
by marriage. Indeed, the same family seems to
have reigned in both kingdoms. “Godfrey, son of Harold,
King of the Hebrides,” who was slain by the Dal Riada
in 989<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> was in all probability a son of that “Harold, lord
of the foreigners of Limerick,” whose death is recorded by
the Four Masters in 940.</p>

<p>Practically nothing is known of the Scandinavian settlement
in Waterford<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> (O.N. <i>Vethrafjörthr</i>) before the year
919, when Vikings under Raghnall (O.N. Rögnvaldr),
“King of the Danes,” concentrated their forces there
before attacking Dublin. These invaders, sometimes
called Nortmannai (‘Norsemen’), but generally alluded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
to as <i>Gaill</i> (‘foreigners’) must have also included Danes,
as Raghnall’s army was composed of both Danes and
Norsemen;<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> and moreover, both parties are represented as
fighting side by side against the Irish in Waterford.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>Waterford had not at first a dynasty of its own, but was
dependent on the Dublin Kingdom. Olaf Godfreyson seems
to have been in command there while his father was King
of Dublin;<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> and we hear also that when the town was
attacked by the Irish under Cellachan of Cashel, Sihtric,
a prince from Dublin, came with a fleet to relieve it.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Later
in the same century, the kingdom of Waterford stood quite
distinct, and was governed by Ivarr (d. 1000), who was
probably a member of the Dublin royal family. He came
forward as a claimant to the Dublin throne after the murder
of Gluniarainn, son of Olaf Cuaran (989) but was driven
out after a three years’ reign by Sihtric Silken-Beard.
Ivarr’s successors in Waterford, Amond (O.N. <i>Amundr</i>)
and Goistilin Gall were killed in the battle of Clontarf.</p>

<p>In the tenth and eleventh centuries Waterford was
strongly fortified, and, like Limerick, had gates leading
into the town.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> The town itself was built in the form of
a triangle with a tower at each angle,<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> only one of which,
the famous Reginald’s Tower, built in 1003, is still standing.
Gualtier (? Ir. <i>Gall tír</i>, ‘land of the foreigners’), a barony
lying on the west side of the harbour, is supposed to have
been connected with the ‘Ostmen,’ who were obliged to
settle there after the arrival of the English in 1169.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Cork, the seat of a famous school founded by St. Finbar,
fell an easy prey to the Vikings in the first half of the ninth
century. They built forts there and at Youghal,<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> but in
endeavouring to push their way inland to Fermoy were
checked by the Irish (866), and their chief, Gnimcinnsiolla
(or Gnimbeolu)<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> was slain. We hear no more of Scandinavians
here until early in the tenth century when new invaders,
part of the large army which came to Waterford with
Raghnall and Earl Ottarr in 919, gained possession of the
town. The new settlers seem to have been chiefly, if not
entirely, Danes (<i>Danair</i> and <i>Duibhgeinnti</i>),<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> and it would
seem that with the Danish colonies at Thurles and
Cashel they subsequently came under the authority of
Ivarr of Limerick, “the high-king of the foreigners of
Munster.”</p>

<p>Traces of the Scandinavian occupation still remain in
the place-names on the coast, especially in the districts
surrounding the seaport towns. Near Dublin we find
Howth (O.N. <i>höfuth</i>, ‘a head’) and Skerries (O.N.
<i>skjær</i>, ‘a rock’); also Lambey, Dalkey and Ireland’s Eye,
all three containing the O.N. form <i>ey</i>, an ‘island.’ The name
Leixlip is probably a form of O.N. <i>laxhleypa</i><a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> (‘salmon-leap’)
not, as is generally supposed, of O.N. <i>lax-hlaup</i>. The O.N.
<i>fjörthr</i> occurs in Wexford, Strangford and Carlingford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
(O.N. Kerlingafjörthr).<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Other Scandinavian names on the
east coast are Copeland Islands (<i>i.e.</i>, <i>Kaupmannaeyjar</i>, ‘the
merchants’ islands’) near Belfast Lough; Arklow, Wicklow
(O.N. <i>lo</i>, a low, flat meadow by the water’s edge.); Carnsore
and Greenore (O.N. <i>eyrr</i>, ‘a small tongue of land running
into the sea’).</p>

<p>The number of names on the south and west coasts
is limited; besides Water<i>ford</i>, we find only Hel<i>vick</i> (O.N.
<i>vík</i>, ‘a bay’), Dursey Island, south-west of Cork, and
Swerwick Harbour, in Kerry. At least three well-authenticated
place-names have dropped out of use; Dún
na Trapcharla, in Co. Limerick (O.N. (1) <i>torf-karl</i>, ‘a
turf-cutter’ or (2) <i>thorp-karl</i>, a ‘small farmer’);<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
Jolduhlaup,<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> a cape in the north of Ireland; and
Ulfreksfjörthr,<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> the Norse name for Lough Larne.</p>

<p>It is also interesting to note that the second element
in the names of the three provinces, Ulster, Leinster and
Munster is derived from the O.N. <i>stathir</i> (plural of <i>stathr</i>,
‘a place’), while the name Ireland (O.N. Iraland) is Scandinavian
in form and replaced the old Irish word Eríu during
the Viking period.</p>

These colonies were governed by earls, not kings, and their
dependency on the kingdom of Dublin is clearly shown by certain
entries in the Annals. In 926 a Viking fleet at Linn Duachaill (on
the coast of Louth) was commanded by Albdann (O.N. <i>Halfdanr</i>),
son of Guthfrith (King of Dublin, 920-933). Later, when part of
Albdann’s army was besieged at Ath Cruithne (near Newry),
Guthfrith went with his forces to relieve it. In 927 the “foreigners

would acquire a legendary character after the Norsemen had been
driven out of Ireland, and would figure, like the Lochlannaigh or
Norsemen, in Middle-Irish stories and poems.

THE EXPANSION OF IRISH TRADE.</h2>

<p>When the Scandinavians had firmly established themselves
on the Irish coasts they developed trade to a considerable
extent, not only by bringing Ireland into communication
with their new settlements in England, but also by opening
up commerce with Iceland and Scandinavia, and even
with Russia and the East.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> Before <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 900 at all events,
they had been accustomed to visit France from Ireland,
and had trafficked with merchants there, using a certain
vessel called the ‘Epscop’<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> for measuring their wine. That
this branch of their trade was in a flourishing condition in
the latter half of the tenth century may be inferred from a
contemporary poem in which Brian Borumha is said to
have exacted as tribute one hundred and fifty vats of wine
from the Norsemen of Dublin, and a barrel of red wine
every day from the Limerick settlers.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>The Scandinavians also made marked advances on the
old methods of trading by building their forts near the
large harbours and carrying on from there a continuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
overseas commerce.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Previous to this foreign merchants<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
who visited Ireland used to exchange their goods for home
produce at the numerous <i>oenachs</i> or fairs held at certain
intervals all over the country. These <i>oenachs</i> continued
to be celebrated during the Viking period, but it was in the
seaport towns, Dublin, Limerick, Cork, Wexford, and
Waterford, that the most important trade was centred.
Dublin, owing to its splendid position, half way between
the Continent and the Scandinavian settlements in Scotland
and Iceland, and within easy distance of England, became
one of the wealthiest towns in the West. One Irish chronicler
gives a glowing account of the treasures carried off from there
by the Irish after the battle of Gleann Máma (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1000):</p>

<p>“In that one place were found the greatest quantities
of gold, silver, bronze, and precious stones: carbuncle-gems,
buffalo horns, and beautiful goblets… much also of various
vestures of all colours were found there likewise.”<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>Dublin is frequently mentioned in the sagas and seems
to have been very well known to Icelandic dealers. In <i>Olaf
Tryggvason’s Saga</i> (<i>Heimskringla</i>) we read that during the
reign of Olaf Cuaran a merchant called Thórir Klakka, who
had been on many a Viking expedition, went on a trading
voyage to Dublin, “as was usual in those days.”<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> When
<i>Olaf’s</i> son, Sihtric Silken Beard, was King of Dublin (c. 994)
the Icelandic poet Gunnlaug Ormstungu sailed from England
to Ireland with merchants who were bound for Dublin.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Eyrbyggia Saga</i> tells<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> of both Thórodd, the owner of a
large ship of burden, and Guthleif,<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> who went with other
traders on voyages “west to Dublin.” Still more interesting
is the account in the same saga of a merchant-ship that came
from Dublin in the year 1000 to Snaefellsness in Iceland
and anchored there for the summer. There were on board
some Irishmen and men from the Sudreyar (Hebrides) but
only a few Norsemen. One of the passengers, a woman named
Thorgunna, had a large chest containing “bed-clothes
beautifully embroidered, English sheets, a silken quilt, and
other valuable wares, the like of which were rare in Iceland.”<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>Limerick is heard of only once in Icelandic sources; a
trader named Hrafn was surnamed “the Limerick-farer”
(Hlymreks fari)<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> because he had lived for a long time there.
The <i>War of the Gaedhil with the Gaill</i> gives a detailed description
of the spoils gained by the Irish after the battle of
Sulcoit (968) whence it would seem that the Limerick
Vikings had been engaged in trade with France, Spain and
the East.</p>

<p>“They carried away their (<i>i.e.</i>, ‘The Vikings’) jewels
and their best property, their saddles, beautiful and foreign,
their gold and their silver; their beautifully woven cloth
of all colours and of all kinds; their satins and their silken
cloths, pleasing and variegated, both scarlet and green,
and all sorts of cloth in like manner.”<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>Reference has already been made to the numbers of Irish
women captured by Viking raiders; many of these captives
were afterwards sold as slaves in Norway and Iceland. In
<i>Laxdaela Saga</i> we hear of Melkorka, an Irish princess, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
was exposed for sale with eleven other women at a market
in Norway. The slave-dealer, a man known as Gilli (Ir.
Giolla) “the Russian” was in all probability a Scandinavian
merchant from Ireland who had carried on trade with
Russia. The extent of the slave traffic is further illustrated
in <i>Kristni Saga</i> (ch. 3) where mention is made of “a fair
Irish maid” whom Thangbrandr the priest bought; “and
when he came home with her a certain man whom the
emperor Otto the Young had put as steward there, wished
to take her from him,” but Thangbrandr would not let her
go!<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> On the other hand, the Irish frequently descended on
the Viking strongholds in Ireland and carried off the Norse
women and children, “the soft, youthful, bright, matchless
girls; blooming, silk-clad young women, and active, large
well-formed boys.”<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Therefore it is not unlikely that the
“slaves ignorant of Gaelic” who are stated to have been
given as tribute to the Irish kings in the ninth and tenth
centuries<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> were really Scandinavian prisoners of war.</p>

<p>An interesting passage in the <i>Book of Ely</i> gives an idea
of the activity of the Irish merchants at this period:
“Certain merchants from Ireland, with merchandise of
different kinds and some coarse woollen blankets, arrived
at the little town called Grantebrycge (Cambridge) and
exposed their wares there.”<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> It is not surprising then that
the wealth of Ireland increased rapidly, so much so that
Brian Borumha, realising that this was largely due to Viking
enterprise, allowed the invaders to remain in their forts
on the coast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span> “for the purpose of attracting commerce from
other countries to Ireland.”<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> And even after their defeat
at Clontarf, the Vikings remained in the coast towns,
whence they continued to engage in trade with England
and the Continent. Both Giraldus Cambrensis<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> and William
of Malmesbury<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> mention the extensive slave-trade carried
on between Ireland and England in the twelfth century,
Bristol being the chief centre. In addition to the slave
traffic, large supplies of wine were imported from France,
while the Irish ‘out of gratitude’ (<i>non ingrata</i>) gave hides
and skins in exchange.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> That there was commercial intercourse
with Chester and also with the towns round the
Bristol Channel may be seen from the names of the citizens
of Dublin in the year 1200: Thorkaill, Swein Ivor from
Cardiff; Turstinus and Ulf from Bristol; Godafridus and
Ricardus from Swansea; Thurgot from Haverfordwest and
Harold from Monmouth.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> About 1170 two ships sailing
from England “laden with English cloths and a great
store of goods” were attacked and plundered near Dublin
by a Norseman, Swein, son of Asleif; and some years later
vessels from Britain carrying corn and wine were seized in
Wexford harbour by the English invaders.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>The historical evidence is amply borne out by the existence
of such old Norse loan-words in Irish as <i>mangaire</i> (O.N.
mangari, a ‘trader’), <i>marg</i> (O.N. mörk, a ‘mark’), margadh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
(O.N. markathr, a ‘market’), and <i>penning</i> (O.N. penningr,
a ‘penny’), and also by certain archæological discoveries.
In Scandinavia coins of King Sithric Silken-Beard have been
found,<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> while four sets of bronze scales and some weights
richly decorated in enamel and gold have been dug up in
Ireland (Bangor, Co. Down).<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> To the same period (early
ninth century) also belong the scales and weights which were
discovered in the great hoard at Islandbridge, near Kilmainham
in 1866.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> With such strong evidence of the influence
exerted by the Vikings on the expansion of Irish trade it
is not surprising to find that even as late as the seventeenth
century the greater part of the merchants of Dublin traced
their descent to Olaf Cuaran and the Dublin Norsemen.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

SHIPBUILDING AND SEAFARING.</h2>

<p>The almost complete absence of any allusion to Irish ships<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
during the eighth and ninth centuries shows that at this
time the Irish had no warships to drive back the powerful
naval forces of the Vikings. Meeting with no opposition
on sea the invaders were able to anchor their fleets in the
large harbours, and afterwards to occupy certain important
positions along the coasts. In this connection it is interesting
to note that the Irish word <i>longphort</i> (a ‘shipstead’; later,
‘a camp’) is used for the first time in the <i>Annals of Ulster</i>
with reference to the Norse encampments at Dublin and
Linn-Duachaill (840); hence it has been concluded that
the early Norse <i>long-phorts</i> were not exactly fortified camps,
but ‘ships drawn up and protected on the landside, probably
by a stockaded earthwork.’<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>The Annalists tell how, when the Vikings were expelled
from Dublin in 902, they fled across the sea to England,
leaving large numbers of their ships behind them. It was
probably the capture of these vessels that impressed upon
the Irish the advantages of this new method of warfare,
for they now began to build ships and to prepare to meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the Vikings in their own element.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> In 913 a “new fleet,”
manned by Ulstermen, attacked the Norsemen off the coast
of Man but was defeated.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> Another Ulster fleet commanded
by Muirchertach mac Neill, King of Aileach, sailed to the
Hebrides in 939 and carried off much spoil and booty.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
Moreover, the Irish seem to have imitated the Scandinavian
practice of “drawing” or carrying their light vessels over
land to the lakes and rivers in the interior of the island.
Mention is made of Domhnall, son of Muirchertach, who
“took the boats from the river Bann on to Lough Neagh,
and over the river Blackwater upon Lough Erne, and
afterwards upon Lough Uachtair.”<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>The men of Munster also had their navy, which they
organised according to Norse methods<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> by compelling each
district in the different counties to contribute ten ships to
it. Thus by the middle of the tenth century they were able
to put a formidable fleet to sea. When Cellachan of Cashel
(d. 954) was captured by the Vikings and brought to Dublin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
he sent messengers to the Munstermen bidding them to
defend their territory: “and afterwards,” he said, “go to
the chieftains of my fleet and bring them with you to Sruth
na Maeile (Mull of Cantyre), and if I am carried away from
Ireland, let the men of Munster take their ships and follow
me.”<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> The chronicle goes on to give a vivid description of
the great naval battle which followed: the Vikings under
the leadership of Sihtric, a prince from Dublin, took up
their position in the Bay of Dundalk, where the “barques
and swift ships of the men of Munster” met them. The
Irish ships were arranged according to the territories they
represented: those of Corcolaigdi and Ui Echach (Co.
Cork) were placed farthest south; next came the fleets of
Corcoduibne and Ciarraige (Co. Kerry), and lastly those
of Clare. When the Munstermen saw Cellachan, who had
been bound and fettered to the mast by Sihtric’s orders,
they made gallant attempts to release him; some of them
leaped upon “the rowbenches and strong oars of the mighty
ships” of the Norsemen, while others threw tough ropes
of hemp across the prows to prevent them from escaping.
Failbhe, King of Corcoduibne, brought his ship alongside
Sihtric’s, and with his sword succeeded in cutting the ropes
and fetters that were round the King, but was himself
slain immediately afterwards. The battle ended in victory
for the Irish: the Norsemen were forced to leave the harbour
with all their ships, but “they carried neither King nor
chieftain with them.”<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>The <i>War of the Gaedhil with the Gaill</i> records still more
victories for the Munster fleet during the reign of Brian
Borumha. In 984 he assembled “a great marine fleet”
on Lough Derg and took three hundred boats up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Shannon to Lough Ree<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> and again in 1001 sailed with his
fleet to Athlone.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> But the greatest triumph of all was in
1005, when Brian, then at the height of his power, “sent
forth a naval expedition composed of the foreigners of
Dublin and Waterford and the Ui Ceinnselaigh (<i>i.e.</i>, the
men of Wexford) and almost all the men of Erin, such of
them as were fit to go to sea; and they levied royal tribute
from the Saxons and the Britons and from the men of
Lennox in Scotland and the inhabitants of Argyle.”<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records the names of a number
of Frisian sailors who fought with the English in a naval
battle against the Vikings (A. an. 897). In the same way the
Irish ships must have been manned to a large extent by Norse
mercenaries or by the Gaill-Gaedhil, for practically all the
shipping terms introduced into Irish in the tenth and
eleventh centuries are of Norse origin.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> This is evident

LINGUISTIC INFLUENCES.</h2>

<h3>(<i>a</i>) Loan-words from Old Norse in Irish.</h3>

<p>The large number of loan-words from Old Norse which
occur in Old and Middle Irish indicate clearly the extent

of Irish and Icelandic sources, that the relations existing
between the two peoples were largely of a friendly character.</p>

<p>Certain old Norse words and phrases which are to be found
in Irish texts also go to show the familiarity of the Irish
with the Norse language. They may be mentioned here,
although they are not loan-words, but rather attempts
on the part of the Irish authors to reproduce the speech
of the foreigners:&mdash;</p>

THE VIKINGS AND THE CELTIC CHURCH.</h2>

<p>Beyond a few meagre allusions the Irish Annals throw no
light on the progress of Christianity among the “foreigners”
in Ireland during the ninth century. Fortunately, however,
the Icelandic Sagas and the <i>Landnámabók</i> have preserved
some interesting details concerning a small number of the
Norse settlers in Iceland, who had previously come under
the influence of Christianity in Ireland and in the Western
Islands of Scotland. As far as we can gather from these
sources the new faith seems at first to have made but little
headway; heathenism retained a strong hold on the majority
of the Norse people, and there can be little doubt that this
form of religion was extensively practised in Ireland during
the Viking age. Evidence of this is to be found in <i>The
War of the Gaedhil with the Gaill</i>, which describes how
Authr, wife of Turgéis, sat on the high altar of the church
in Clonmacnois, and gave audiences as a prophetess.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> In
this instance the high altar would seem to have corresponded
to the <i>seithr hjallr</i> or platform which it was customary to
erect in Icelandic houses when a <i>völva</i> or prophetess was
called in to foretell the future.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Some writers<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> also point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
to the numerous raids on churches and religious houses
as a proof of the Vikings’ hostility to Christianity, but
these attacks were much more likely to have originated in
the amount of treasure which the raiders knew to be stored
in these places. It is rather in this light, too, that we must
regard Turgéis’ expulsion of the abbot Farannan from
Armagh (in 839), and his subsequent usurpation of the
abbacy,<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> than as an attempt to stamp out Christianity
and establish heathenism in its stead.</p>

<p>Yet, at the same time, the Norsemen must have come into
close contact with the religion of the “White Christ”
through their intercourse with the Irish. Indeed, an entry
in the <i>Annals of Ulster</i> (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 872), referring to the death
of Ivárr the Boneless, implies that this famous Viking died
a Christian.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> The records are silent on this point with regard
to Olaf the White, although he was related by marriage
to Ketill Flatnose, a famous chief in the Hebrides, all of
whose family, with the exception of his son, Björn the
Easterner, adopted Christianity. Olaf’s wife, Authr, daughter
of Ketill, was one of the most zealous of these early Norse
converts: “She used to pray at Crossknolls, where she
had crosses erected, because she was baptized, and was a
good Christian.” Before her death she gave orders that she
was to be buried on the seashore, between high and low
water-mark, because she did not wish to lie in unconsecrated
ground. The <i>Landnámabók</i> also says that for some time
after her death her kinsfolk reverenced these knolls, but
in course of time their faith became corrupt, and in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
place they built a temple and offered up sacrifices.<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> We
hear, too, of Orlygr the Old, who had been fostered by
Bishop Patrick in the Hebrides. When he was setting out
for Iceland the Bishop gave him “wood for building a
church, a plenarium, an iron penny and some consecrated
earth to be put under the corner pillars,” and asked him
to dedicate the church to St. Columba. On the voyage a
great storm arose. Orlygr prayed to St. Patrick that he
might reach Iceland in safety, promising, as a thanksgiving,
to call the place in which he should land by the saint’s
name.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> Mention is also made of several other Christians
from the British Isles: Jörundr, Helgi Bjóla;<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> Thorkell&mdash;son
of Svarkell from Caithness&mdash;“who prayed before the
cross, ever good to old men, ever good to young men;”<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
Ásólf,<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Ketill&mdash;grandson of Ketill Flatnose&mdash;who was surnamed
<i>hinn fiflski</i> (‘the foolish’) because he adhered to
Christianity.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> A long time after (c. <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 997) Thangbrandr
the Priest found descendants of Ketill’s in Iceland, “all
of whom had been Christians from father to son.”<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
Considering the missionary ardour of the Irish at this period
it is curious that no priests accompanied these early settlers
to Iceland. This may have been due to scepticism as to the
sincerity of these converts; such, at least, is the impression
received from the Irish annals and chronicles, in which the
Norsemen are almost invariably referred to as ‘heathens’
and ‘pagans.’ The result was that the influence of
Christianity declined in Iceland;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> “some of those who came
from west-the-sea remained Christians until the day of
their death” says the <i>Landnámabók</i>, “but their families
did not always retain the faith, for some of their sons erected
temples and offered sacrifices, and the land was wholly
heathen for nearly one hundred and twenty years.”<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>In the transition from heathenism to Christianity
opposing beliefs were sometimes held at the same time;
the Viking continued to have recourse to Thor even after
he had been baptized. Helgi the Lean, son of Eyvindr the
Easterner, and Rafarta, daughter of King Cearbhall of
Ossory, “was very mixed in his faith; he believed in
Christ, but he invoked Thor for seafaring and brave deeds.
When he came in sight of Iceland he asked Thor where
he should settle down;” and when he had built his house,
“he made a large fire near every lake and river, thus sanctifying
all the land between… Helgi believed in Christ, and
therefore named his house after Him.”<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> We also read that
“Örlygr the Old and his family trusted in Columba,”<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
but whether they abandoned all other belief in the Christian
faith and fell into Paganism is not quite clear. Again, in
the account of the naval battle between Danes and Norsemen
in Carlingford Lough (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 852) the annalist describes
how “Lord Horm,” leader of the Danish forces, advised
his men to “pray fervently” to St. Patrick, “the
archbishop and head of the saints of Erin,” whose churches
and monasteries the Norsemen had plundered and burned.
So the Danes put themselves under the protection of the
saint: “Let our protector,” they cried, “be the holy
Patrick and the God who is lord over him also, and let our
spoils and our wealth be given to his church.” After the
battle ambassadors from the <i>árd-rí</i> found the Danes seated
round a great fire, cooking their food in cauldrons&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
were supported on the dead bodies of the Norsemen, while
near by was “a trench full of gold and silver to give to
Patrick; for the Danes,” adds the chronicler, “were a
people with a kind of piety; they could for a while refrain
from meat and from women.”<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>This confusion of the two religions is also illustrated in
the crosses, symbols of Christianity, which the Vikings
erected in the north of England and in the Isle of Man to
the memory of their kinsfolk. On the Gosforth cross in
Cumberland a representation of the Crucifixion&mdash;obviously
influenced by Celtic designs&mdash;is found side by side with a
figure of the god Vitharr slaying the Wolf, a scene described
in Vafthrúthnismál; while on the western side
of the cross is portrayed the punishment of Loki.<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> A fragment
of a cross in the same locality shows Thor fishing
for the Mithgarthsormr,<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> a subject which is also treated
on a cross slab in Kirk Bride Parish Church, Isle of Man.<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
Among the many other Celtic crosses in Man are four upon
which are carved pictures from the story of Sigurthr
Fáfnisbani: Sigurthr roasting the dragon’s heart on the
fire and cooling his fingers in his mouth, his steed Grani
and the tree with the talking birds; another figure has been
identified with Loki throwing stones at the Otter.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> There
are besides twenty-six crosses with Runic inscriptions, six
of which bring out the Viking connection with the Celtic
Church. On one the Ogam alphabet is scratched, and the
same monument bears a Runic inscription which tells us
that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span> “Mal Lumkun (Ir. Mael Lomchon) raised this cross
to his foster (mother) Malmuru (Ir. Maelmuire), daughter
of Tufgal (Ir. Dubhgall), whom Athisl had to wife.” To this
the rune writer adds: “It is better to leave a good foster-son
than a bad son.”<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> Crosses were also erected by Mail
Brikti (Ir. Mael Brigde), son of Athakan (Ir. Aedhacan)
the smith;<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> by Thorleifr Hnakki in remembrance of his
son Fiak (Ir. Fiacca);<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> and by an unknown Norseman to
the memory of his wife Murkialu (Ir. Muirgheal).<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> Another
cross-slab commemorates Athmiul (? Ir. Cathmaoil), wife
of Truian (<i>i.e.</i>, the Pictish name <i>Druian</i>), son of Tufkal,<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
while still another stone contains a fragment of a prayer
to Christ, and the Irish saints, Malaki (Malachy), Bathrik
(Patrick), and Athanman (Adamnan).<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>The advance of Christianity during the tenth century
may be attributed to a large extent to the prevalence of
the practice known as <i>prime-signing</i> or marking with the
sign of the cross. According to <i>Eyrbyggja Saga</i> (ch. 50),
this was “a common custom among merchants and
mercenary soldiers in Christian armies, because those men
who were ‘prime-signed’ could associate with Christians
as well as heathens, while retaining that faith which they
liked best.” Nearly all the Norse kings who reigned in
Dublin during this century seem to have accepted
Christianity. When Gothfrith plundered Armagh in 919
“he spared the church and the houses of prayer, with their
company of culdees (ceile-de) and the sick.”<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> We may assume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
that Sihtric Gale, Gothfrith’s brother (or cousin) was also
a Christian, since he formed a friendly alliance with Aethelstan,
who gave him his sister in marriage.<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> In 943 Olaf
Cuaran was baptized, and in the same year Rögnvaldr,
another Norse prince, was confirmed.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> After the battle
of Tara (980) Olaf went on pilgrimage to Iona, where he
died “after penance and a good life.”<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> His daughter and
grandson were called by distinctively Irish Christian names&mdash;Maelmuire<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
(servant of Mary), and Gilla Ciarain<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> (servant
of St. Ciaran). We may also note the name Gilla-Padraig
which occurs in the royal family of Waterford<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> and the
half-Irish name of a priest in Clonmacnois, Connmhach
Ua Tomrair, who must have been of Norse extraction.<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>But all traces of heathenism in Ireland had not disappeared
by the end of the tenth century. An interesting relic was
Thor’s ring (Ir. <i>fail Tomhair</i>) which was carried off from
Dublin by King Maelsechnaill II. in 994.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> This must have
been the <i>dóm-hringr</i>, so frequently alluded to in Icelandic
literature. It was a ring of silver or gold, about twenty
ounces in weight, which lay upon an altar in the temple,
except during ceremonies, when it was worn on the priest’s
arm.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> Upon this ring oaths were usually sworn.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> That it
was connected with the worship of Thor is clear from a
passage in the <i>Landnámabók</i> describing a place called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Thorsnes in Iceland: “there still stands Thor’s stone,
on which were broken the backs of those men who were
about to be sacrificed, and close by is the <i>dómhringr</i> where
the men were condemned to death.”<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Even as late as the
year <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1000 we hear of Thor’s wood (<i>caill Tomair</i>)
north of Dublin, which was laid waste by Brian Borumha
after the battle of Gleann Mama.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>The battle of Clontarf (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1014) is frequently represented
as a great fight between Pagan and Christian, but this
point of view is hardly confirmed by the historical facts.
It is true that the Norsemen numbered among their
supporters such prominent upholders of heathenism as
Sigurthr, earl of Orkney, and Broder&mdash;who had been a
mass-deacon, but “now worshipped fiends, and was of all
men most skilled in sorcery,” yet it must be remembered
that the Leinstermen, under their king Maelmordha, also
formed part of the Norse army on the same occasion. Moreover,
both the Norse and Irish accounts of the battle agree
that Gormflaith, who had been the wife of Brian Borumha,
inspired by hatred of Brian, was mainly responsible for the
renewal of hostilities between the two peoples. Her son,
Sihtric Silken Beard, who was most active in mobilising
the Norse troops, must have been a Christian, since the
coins which were minted in Dublin during his reign are
stamped with the sign of the cross. In 1028 he visited
Rome, and there is record of another visit some years later.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
His death is entered in the Annals under the year 1042,
in which same year his daughter, a nun in an Irish convent,
also died.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>It was probably on his return to Dublin from Rome in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
1036 that Sihtric gave “a place on which to build a church
of the Blessed Trinity,” afterwards known as Christchurch
Cathedral, and “contributed gold and silver wherewith to
build it.”<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>The Norsemen would seem to have regarded the
Irish Church with no friendly feelings. The first Norse
bishop, Dunan or Donatus, was on intimate terms with
Lanfranc, and when the next bishop, Patrick, was chosen
by the clergy and people of Dublin, he was sent, with a
letter professing their “bounden obedience” to Lanfranc
for consecration (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1074).<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> His successors, Donatus
(d. 1095), Samuel (d. 1121), and Gregory (d. 1162) were also
consecrated at Canterbury, and acknowledged the supremacy
of the archbishop. An interesting letter addressed to the
Archbishop of Canterbury by the priests and citizens of
Dublin in 1121 is still extant: “You know,” the letter
runs, “that the bishops of Ireland, more especially the
Bishop of Armagh, is extremely angry with us because we
will not submit to his decrees, and because we always wish
to remain under your authority.”<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p>Bishoprics were founded at Waterford and Wexford
later than in Dublin. Malcus, the first Bishop of Waterford,
was consecrated at Canterbury, and on his arrival in
Waterford in 1096, he began to build a church, dedicated,
like that of Dublin, to the Holy Trinity.<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>Some years later we hear of a Bishop of Limerick, Gilla
or Gilbert, who does not seem to have been consecrated
in England, but who was in close touch with the Archbishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of Canterbury.<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> He it was who convoked the synod at
Rathbresail, at which it was decided to divide Ireland into
dioceses: “there,” says Keating, “the sees and dioceses of the
bishops of Ireland were regulated; Dublin was excluded,
because it was not customary for its bishop to receive
consecration except from the Archbishop of Canterbury.”<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
Limerick and Waterford were placed under the jurisdiction
of the Bishop of Cashel, but this decree seems to have been
ignored by the people of Limerick, for they elected their
next bishop, Patrick, in the ordinary way and sent him
to England for consecration.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> It is uncertain whether the
Waterford people obeyed, as the records merely mention
the names of the succeeding bishops.</p>

<p>A still more important synod was held at Kells in 1132.
There the decision of the previous synod regarding the
division of the country into dioceses was ratified, and
archbishoprics were established at Dublin, Armagh, Cashel,
and Tuam. Henceforth the bishops of Dublin, Limerick,
and Waterford were consecrated in Ireland, and this marked
the close of the connection between Canterbury and the
Celtic Church.</p>

probably due to the same causes, was taking place in England about
the same time. The <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> first mentions a naval

because he always wore the Irish kilts; and his son, Harold Gilli,
who could speak Irish better than Norse, “much wore the Irish

<i>Konungs Skuggsjá</i> (<i>Speculum Regale</i>):
</p>
<p>
“It happens that when two hosts meet and are arranged in battle-array,
and when the battle-cry is raised loudly on both sides,
cowardly men run wild and lose their wits from the dread and fear
which seize them. And they run into a wood away from other men,
and live there like beasts and shun the meeting of men like wild
beasts. And it is said of these men then when they have lived in the
woods in that condition for twenty years, that feathers grew on
their bodies like birds, whereby their bodies are protected against
frost and cold…”

This bears a striking resemblance to a certain passage in the
mediæval romance <i>Cath Muighe Rath</i> (Battle of Moy Rath, p. 232.

which probably dates from the same period, viz., <i>Buile Suibhne</i>,

LITERARY INFLUENCE: THE SAGAS OF
ICELAND AND IRELAND.</h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>The most interesting branch of early Norse literature is
the saga or prose story. Of these there are many varieties
but the most distinctive are the following: (1) the <i>Íslendinga
Sögur</i>, or stories relating to prominent Icelanders, (2)
<i>Konunga Sögur</i>, or stories of Kings, chiefly of Norway;
(3) <i>Fornaldar Sögur</i>, or stories about early times. All these
are essentially Icelandic in origin; sagas having their
origin in Norway are by no means unknown, but they are,
as a rule, translated or derived from French and other
foreign sources.<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> In their present form the sagas relating
to the history of Iceland date for the most part from the
thirteenth century, though some of them were probably
committed to writing in the latter part of the twelfth.</p>

<p>The earliest Icelandic document of which we have any
record is the original text of the Laws, said to have been
written in the year 1181. Ari’s <i>Íslendinga-Bók</i>, containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
a short account of the settlement of Iceland with notices
of the more important events, and accounts of the succession
of lawmen and bishops, was written a few years later, though
the form in which it has come down to us is that of an
abbreviated text written about the year 1130. This work,
the foundation of all subsequent historical writing in
Iceland, contains some short notices, which apparently
had been handed down by tradition, but these stories,
usually known as sagas, would seem to have been written
down somewhat later. Indeed until the close of the twelfth
century the language employed for historical writings in
Iceland, as elsewhere, was for the most part Latin.</p>

<p>Though the writing of the sagas did not begin until the
latter part of the twelfth century, sagas in some form
or other must have been in existence much earlier, carried
on from generation to generation by oral tradition. This
faculty of reciting sagas was a special characteristic of the
Icelanders, by whom it was carefully cultivated. In the
preface to his <i>Historia Danica</i> Saxo acknowledges his
indebtedness to the “men of Thule,” who “account it a
delight to learn and to consign to remembrance the history
of all nations, deeming it as great a glory to set forth the
excellence of others as to display their own. Their stores,
which are stocked with attestations of historical events,
I have examined somewhat closely and have woven together
no small portion of the present work by following their
narrative.”<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>That the art of story-telling did not decline in Iceland
even after the majority of the sagas were written down is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
attested by <i>Sturlunga Saga</i>. Here we are told that when
Sturla visited King Magnus’ court at Bergen in 1263 the
king received him coldly, but afterwards allowed him to
accompany the royal party on a voyage to the south of
Norway. In the evening one of the sailors asked if there
was anyone among them who could tell stories, but he
received no answer. He turned to Sturla, “Sturla, the
Icelander, will you entertain us?” “Willingly,” said
Sturla. Then he related the story of Huld<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> better and
with much more detail than any of those present had ever
heard it told before. Then many men made their way to
the deck so as to hear as clearly as possible, and there was
a great crowd there. The queen asked: “What is that
crowd on the deck?” A man answered, “Men who are
listening to the tale the Icelander is telling.” “What
story is that?” she asked. “It is about a great giantess;
it is a good story and well told.” On the following day the
queen sent for Sturla and asked him to come and bring
with him the saga of the giantess.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> So Sturla went aft to
the quarterdeck and told the story over again. When he
had finished, the queen and many of the listeners thanked
him and took him to be a learned and wise man.<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>A much earlier reference to the recitation, and indeed
the composition of sagas is found in <i>Thorgils Saga ok
Haflitha</i>, in which there is an account of a wedding-feast
at Reykholar in 1119:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>
<p>“There was fun and merriment and great festivity, and
all kinds of amusements, such as dancing, wrestling and
story-telling… Hrólfr of Skalmarnes told a story about
Hrongvithr the Viking, and Olaf ‘the sailor’s king,’ and
about the rifling of the barrow of Thrainn the berserkr,
and about Hrómundr Gripsson, and he included many
verses in his story. King Sverrir used to be entertained
with this story, and he declared that fictitious stories like
these were the most entertaining of any; and yet there are
men who can trace their ancestry to Hrómundr Gripsson.
Hrólfr had put this saga together. Ingimundr the priest
told the story of Ormr, the poet of Barrey and included
many verses in it, besides a good poem which Ingimundr
had composed, therefore many learned men regard this
saga as true.”<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>The former of these stories is the <i>Hrómundra Saga</i> which
belongs to the class commonly called <i>Fornaldar Sögur</i>.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>Still further back in the reign of Harald Hardradith (1047-1066)
we have a most important allusion to the art of story-telling.
According to the saga<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> a young Icelander came one
summer to King Harald seeking his protection. The king
received him into his court on the understanding that he
should entertain the household during the winter. He soon
became very popular, and received gifts from members
of the household and from the king himself. Just before
Christmas the king noticed that the Icelander seemed
dejected, and he asked the reason. The Icelander replied
that it was because of his ‘uncertain temper.’</p>

<p>“That is not so,” said the king…<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> “I think your stock
of sagas must be exhausted, because you have entertained
us all through the winter, whenever you were called upon
to do so. Now you are worried because your sagas have
come to an end at Christmas time, and you do not wish to
tell the same over again.”</p>

<p>“You have guessed rightly,” said the Icelander. “I
know only one more saga, but I dare not tell it here, because
it is the story of your adventures abroad.”</p>

<p>“That is the saga I particularly want to hear,” said
the king, and he asked the Icelander to begin it on Christmas
Day and tell a part of it every day. During the Christmas
season there was a good deal of discussion about the entertainment.
Some said it was presumption on the part of
the Icelander to tell the saga and they wondered how the
king would like it; others thought it was well told, but others
again thought less of it. When the saga was finished, the
king, who had listened attentively throughout, turned to
the story-teller and said: “Are you not curious to know,
Icelander, how I like the saga?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid to ask,” replied the story-teller.</p>

<p>The king said: “I think you have told it very well.
Where did you get the material for it, and who taught it
to you?”</p>

<p>The Icelander answered: “When in Iceland I used to
go every summer to the <i>Thing</i>, and each summer I learned
a portion of the saga from Halldór Snorrason.”</p>

<p>“Then it is not surprising that you know it so well,
since you have learned it from him,” said the king.</p>

<p>We may in fact see the origin of the <i>Íslendinga Sögur</i>
in certain passages of the sagas themselves. In <i>Fóstbroethra
Saga</i>, for instance, the story is told of an Icelander named
Thormóthr, who went to Greenland in order to avenge the
death of his foster-brother Thorgeirr. On one occasion he
fell asleep in his booth, and when he awoke some time later
he found, to his surprise, that the place was quite deserted.
Then his servant Egill “the foolish” came to him and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
said: “You are too far off from a great entertainment.”</p>

<p>Thormóthr asked: “Where have you come from and
what is the entertainment?”</p>

<p>Egill replied: “I have been to Thorgrímr Einarsson’s
booth and most of the people who are attending the <i>Thing</i>
are there now.”</p>

<p>Thormóthr asked: “What form of amusement have
they?”</p>

<p>Egill answered: “Thorgrímr is telling a saga.”</p>

<p>“About whom is the saga?” asked Thormóthr.</p>

<p>“That I do not know clearly,” replied Egill, “but I
know that he tells it well and in an interesting manner. He
is sitting on a chair outside his booth and the people are all
around him listening to the saga.”</p>

<p>Thormóthr said: “But you must know the name of
some man who is mentioned in the saga, especially since
you think it so entertaining.”</p>

<p>Egill replied: “A certain Thorgeirr was a great hero in
the saga, and I think that Thorgrímr himself must have
had some connection with it, and played a brave part in
it, as is most likely. I wish you would go there and listen
to the entertainment.”<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>Then Thormóthr and Egill went to Thorgrímr’s booth
and stood close by listening to the saga, but they could not
hear it very distinctly. Thormóthr had, however, understood
from Egill’s remarks that this was the same
Thorgrímr who had slain his foster-brother and was now
recounting his exploits for the amusement of the crowd.</p>

<p>More famous is the scene in <i>Njáls Saga</i> where Gunnar
Lambi’s son, who has just arrived at Earl Sigurthr’s palace
in the Orkneys is called upon to tell the story of the
burning of Njáll’s homestead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“The men were so pleased that King Sigtryggr [of Dublin]
sat on a high seat in the middle, but on either side of the
king sat one of the earls… Now King Sitryggr and Earl
Gille wished to hear of these tidings which had happened
at the burning, and so, also, what had befallen since.</p>

<p>“Then Gunnarr Lambi’s son, who had taken part in the
burning was got to tell the tale, and a stool was set for him
to sit upon…</p>

<p>“Now King Sigtryggr asked: “How did Skarphethinn
bear the burning?”</p>

<p>““Well at first for a long time,” said Gunnarr, “but still
the end of it was that he wept.” And so he went on giving
an unfair bias to his story, but every now and then he
laughed aloud.</p>

<p>“Kári (Kjall’s friend who was listening outside) could
not stand this and he then ran in with his sword drawn…
and smote Gunnarr Lambi’s son on the neck with such a
smart blow that his head spun off on to the board before
the king and the earls.</p>

<p>“… Now Flosi undertook to tell the story of the Burning
and he was fair to all, and therefore what he said was
believed.”<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>For the way in which such stories were preserved from
generation to generation we may refer to the end of
<i>Droplaugarsona Saga</i> (Ljósvetninga): “Thorvaldr (born c.
1006) son of Grímr”&mdash;one of the chief actors in the story&mdash;“had
a son called Ingjaldr. His son was named Thorvaldr,
and he it was who told the story.”<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>The passage quoted from <i>Njála Saga</i> and <i>Fóstbroethra
Saga</i> seem to show that the art of story-telling was already
developed at the beginning of the eleventh century. In these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
instances, it is true, we have only the records of events given
by the actors themselves or by eyewitnesses, and we cannot
be certain that such stories had assumed anything like a
fixed form. Far more important is the passage from <i>Haralds
Saga Hardrada</i>,<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> for there the story-teller was not an eyewitness,
but had obtained the story, or the material for it,
from Halldór Snorrason, an Icelandic follower of King
Harald. From what is said about the length of the saga,
there can be no doubt that it had been worked up in a
very elaborate way. For such elaborate secondhand stories
we have no other definite evidence, but again, considering
the time which the recital is said to have occupied, it would
be unwise to conclude that this later form of the art was
entirely new.</p>

<p>We have, therefore, clearly to distinguish two stages in
the history of the oral saga; (i) the story as told by someone
who had taken part in the events described; (ii) the
secondhand story. The story was soon embellished, especially
in the second stage, not merely with such devices as the
records of conversation, but even by the introduction of
imaginary adventures. Indeed we need not assume that
even in the first stage the stories were told in strict
accordance with fact. Reference may be made, for instance,
to the passage quoted above from <i>Njáls Saga</i>, where
Gunnarr Lambi’s son is said to have told the story of the
burning unfairly. Even in the <i>Íslendinga</i> and <i>Konunga
Sögur</i> fiction forms a not inconsiderable element: in the
<i>Fornaldar Sögur</i> it is obviously much greater.</p>

<p>Yet there is good reason for believing that in the main
the <i>Íslendinga</i> and <i>Konunga Sögur</i> are historical. This
may be seen by the general agreement between the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
sagas, since the same characters constantly reappear, and
there is little inconsistency with regard to their circumstances
or personal traits. Again, the description of houses, ships,
weapons, and other articles seems generally to correspond
to those known to date from the period to which the stories
refer. There is, moreover, one feature which points to a
more or less fixed tradition dating from the closing years
of the tenth century, namely, the attitude towards those
characters who figured prominently in the struggle between
Christianity and heathenism. Thus there are indications
that the rather unsympathetic representation of Harold
Greycloak and his brothers may be due to the fact that they
were Christians. Still more significant is the attitude of
the sagas towards Haakon the Bad, whose character seems
to undergo a great change&mdash;probably a reflection of the
change in the popular opinion of Christianity.</p>

<p>Sagas like those of Egill and Kormak relating to the
middle or first part of the twelfth century are few in number
and usually contain a considerable amount of poetry; in
fact, the prose is not infrequently based upon the poetry.
Stories dealing with early Icelandic history from <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 874
onwards and Norwegian history of the same period are much
less full. In general they appear to be trustworthy, but
the details are such as might have been preserved by local
or family tradition without the special faculty which is
characteristic of the sagas.</p>

<p>Of a totally different character are the sagas relating to
times before the settlement of Iceland (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 874). Some
of these, such as <i>Völsunga Saga</i> and <i>Hervarar Saga</i>, deal
with events as far back as the fifth century, and are, to a
great extent, paraphrases of poems, many of which have
come down to us. Very frequently, too, whether based on
poems or not, the narrative bears the stamp of fiction.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Conditions in Iceland were especially favourable to the
development of the art of story-telling, owing partly to the
isolated position of the country itself and to the difficulties
of communication across the wide tracts of land separating
the various settlements within it, partly also to the love of
travel which characterised its inhabitants. In Icelandic
literature the recital of stories is mentioned in connection
with public meetings&mdash;such as the annual general assembly
(<i>Althingi</i>)&mdash;and with social gatherings at the “winter-nights,”
the chief season for hospitality in Iceland, when
travellers had returned from abroad.</p>

<p>The Icelanders were famous, too, for the cultivation of
poetry. This art was evidently much practised in Norway
in early times, but we hear of hardly any Norwegian poets
after Eyvindr (c. 980), whereas in Iceland poetry flourished
for a considerable period after this. Icelandic poets were
received with favour not only in Norway, but elsewhere,
for instance, in England and Ireland. It has been stated
that sagas dealing with the early part of the tenth century
owe a good deal to poetry, while stories relating to times
earlier than the settlement of Iceland are often almost
entirely dependent on poetic sources. Moreover, the cultivation
of poetry probably contributed very largely to the
development of the faculty of story-telling, and the two
arts may have been practised by the same person. On this
point, however, we have no precise information.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Yet the remarkable fact that this faculty of story-telling
was peculiar to the Icelanders alone among the Teutonic
peoples still remains to be explained. It can hardly be
without significance that the only parallel in Europe for
such a form of literature is to be found in Ireland.</p>

<p>From the allusions to this type of composition in old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Irish literature it would seem to have existed at a very
early period; so early, that its very origin is obscure. There
is, for example, mention of a king’s “company of story
tellers” in the eight lines of satirical verse, said to have
been composed by the poet Cairbre on Bress, the niggardly
king of the Formorians.<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>Story-telling was one of the many attractions of the great
<i>aonachs</i> or fairs which played the same part in the national
life of Ireland as the <i>things</i> or popular assemblies in Iceland.
From the poem on the ancient fair of Carman preserved
in the <i>Book of Ballymote</i>, we can form an idea of the entertainment
provided by the professional story-teller:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The tales of Fianna of Erin, a never-wearying entertainment:
stories of destructions, cattle-preys, courtships,
rhapsodies, battle-odes, royal precepts and the truthful
instructions of Fithil the sage: the wide precepts of Coirfic
and Cormac.”<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Book of Leinster</i> states that the poet who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
attained the rank of <i>ollamh</i> was bound to know for recital
to kings and chieftains two hundred and fifty tales of prime
importance (prím-scéla), and one hundred secondary ones.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>
The same source gives the names of one hundred and
eighty-seven of these tales, the majority of which have not
come down to us. These include stories from the three
great cycles of legend, viz., that relating to the gods; to
Cuchulain and the warriors of the Red Branch, and to Finn
and Fianna. A number of stories relating to the kings of
Ireland mentioned in this list have an historical basis;
while there are others purporting to deal with kings as far
back as 1000 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, which are no doubt partly imaginary,
and were invented to arouse popular interest in the past
history of the country.</p>

<p>We know of several stories and poems about kings and
chieftains who played a prominent part in the wars against
the Vikings. The list in <i>The Book of Leinster</i> mentions
only one, <i>The Love of Gormflaith for Niall</i> <i>i.e.</i>, Niall
Glundubh (d. 919), a summary of which is contained in
the mediæval English translation of <i>The Annals of
Clonmacnois</i>. In the case of <i>The Victorious Career of
Cellachan of Cashel</i>, it is difficult to say whether this was
originally an oral narrative committed to writing for the
first time in the fifteenth century, or whether it was copied
from an older manuscript, now lost. Brian Borumha and
his sons are the principal characters in <i>The Leeching of
Cian’s Leg</i>, a tale preserved in a sixteenth century manuscript.<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
It is interesting to note here the presence of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
strong folk element which would seem to point towards
a popular, not a literary origin.</p>

<p>At the close of the tenth century story-telling was in
high favour in Ireland, and the professional story-teller
was able not only to recite any one of the great historical
tales, but to improvise, if the occasion arose. Mac Coisse,
the poet attached to the court of Maelsechnaill II., tells
in an interesting prose work how his castle at Clartha (Co.
Westmeath) was once plundered by the O’Neills of Ulster.
He immediately set out for Aileach in order to obtain
compensation from the head of the clan, King Domhnall
O’Neill (d. 978). On his arrival, he was received with great
honour and brought into the king’s presence. In response
to Domhnall’s request for a story, Mac Coisse mentioned
the names of a large number of tales including one called
<i>The Plunder of the Castle of Maelmilscotach</i>. This was the
only one with which the king was unfamiliar, so he asked
the story-teller to relate it. In it Mac Coisse described,
under the form of an allegory, the plundering of his castle
by the king’s kinsmen. When he had finished he confessed
that he himself was Maelmilscotach<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>, and he begged the
king to grant him full restitution of his property. This
the king agreed to do, and the grateful poet then recited
a poem of eighteen stanzas which he had composed about
the king and his family.<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The resemblance which we have noted between Icelandic
and Irish customs seem to justify us in suggesting that they
may be due in part to some influence exercised by the one
people upon the other. There is in fact a certain amount
of evidence which renders such influence probable. We
know that Irish poets and story-tellers were welcome guests
at the court of the Scandinavian kings in Ireland. In an
elegy on Mathgamain, Brian’s brother,<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> one of the Munster
bards, says he finds it difficult to reproach the foreigners
because of his friendship with Dubhcena, Ivarr’s son.<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
And during the lifetime of Brian, Mac Liag, Brian’s chief
poet, and Mac Coisse, poet and story-teller to Maelsechnaill
II., visited the court of Sigtryggr and remained there for
a whole year. On their departure they gave expression
to their feelings of regret in a poetical dialogue:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse outdent"><i>Mac Liag</i>:</div>
<div class="verse">It is time for us to return to our homes,</div>
<div class="verse">We have been here a whole year;</div>
<div class="verse">Though short to you and me may seem</div>
<div class="verse">This our sojourn in Dublin,</div>
<div class="verse">Brian of Banba deems it too long</div>
<div class="verse">That he listens not to my eloquence.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another poem of Mac Liag’s, in which he addresses the
Scandinavians of Dublin as “the descendants of the
warriors of Norway,” was also composed in Dublin, at the
court of ‘Olaf of the golden shields,’ soon after the battle
of Clontarf.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand Icelandic sources mention at least
three skálds who made their way to Ireland during the
tenth century: Thorgils Orraskáld, who was with Olaf
Cuaran in Dublin,<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> and Kormak (Ir. Cormac) who fought
with Harold Greycloak in Ireland (c. 961).<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> In <i>Gunnlaugs
Saga Ormstungu</i> (ch. 8) there is a charming account of the
poet’s reception in Dublin, shortly after Sigtryggr became
king (c. 994): Gunnlaug went before the king and said:
“I have composed a poem about you, and I would like to
get a hearing for it.”</p>

<p>“The king answered: “No man has yet made a poem about
me, and I will certainly listen to yours.”</p>

<p>“Then Gunnlaug recited his poem in praise of “Cuaran’s
son,” and the king thanked him for it.</p>

<p>“Sigtryggr then called his treasurer and asked: “How
shall I reward him for this poem?”</p>

<p>““As you will, lord,” replied the treasurer.</p>

<p>““Shall I give him two merchant-ships?” asked the
king.</p>

<p>““That is too much,” said the treasurer, “other kings
give, as rewards for songs, costly gifts, good swords or
gold rings.”</p>

<p>“So the king gave Gunnlaug his own garments of new
scarlet cloth, a tunic ornamented with lace, a cloak lined
with choice furs, and a gold ring which weighed a mark.
Gunnlaug remained for a short time there and then went
to the Orkneys.”</p>

<p>It is to be noted, too, that among the original settlers
in Iceland there were a not inconsiderable number who
came from Ireland and the islands off the west coast of
Scotland. These included some of the most important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
families in the country. We may mention especially Authr,
widow of Olaf the White, king of Dublin, with her brothers
Ketill the Foolish, Björn, Helgi Bjóla and all their families
and dependants;<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> also Helgi the Lean who had been
brought up partly in the Hebrides, partly in Ireland,
Jörundr the Christian and Örlygr the Old.<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> Not a few of
these were partly of Irish stock such as Helgi the Lean,
Áskell Hnokkan and his brother Vilbaldr who were descendants
of Cearbhall, king of Ossory (d. 877).<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Sometimes we
hear of settlers who were of pure Gaelic blood, like Kalman
(Ir. Colman) from the Hebrides,<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> and Erpr, son of a Scottish
earl Maeldúin,<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> and Myrgjol (Ir. Muirgheal), daughter of
Gliomall, an Irish king.<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>It has been urged<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> that the persons mentioned in the
<i>Landnámabók</i> as coming from Ireland and Scotland form a
very small percentage of the whole number of settlers.
But we have to remember that by no means all the colonists
are mentioned in the records and genealogies. There can be
no doubt that a number of slaves and freedmen accompanied
the more important settlers to Iceland, and of these probably
the great majority were of Celtic blood. Their numbers, too,
were being continually reinforced during the tenth century.
It is difficult, however, to estimate how many they were,
because in the case of thralls Icelandic names were not
infrequently substituted for Irish ones. Thus, of the Irish
thralls whom Hjörleifr brought to Iceland only one,
Dufthakr, had a Gaelic name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Such slaves were not always people of humble origin.
Gilli (Ir. Giolla), the slave who killed Thorsteinn, son of
Hallr<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> of Side, was a descendant of Cearbhall, king of Ossory.
Mention is made elsewhere of Nithbjörg, daughter of the
Irish king Biolan (Ir. Beollán) who was carried off from
Ireland in a Viking raid;<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> also of Melkorka, King
Myrkjartan’s daughter, who was bought from a slave
dealer in Norway.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> Icelandic custom did not necessarily
prevent the children of slave women from becoming persons
of wealth and influence; indeed Ósvifr, son of Nithbjörg
and Olaf Pái, son of Melkorka, were among the leading
men in Iceland in their time. It is not unreasonable, then,
to suppose that by the end of the tenth century Irish blood
had found its way into a large number of Icelandic families.</p>

<p>Lastly we may observe that the Irish and Icelandic
sagas bear certain resemblances to one another which are
at least worthy of attention. In both cases the narrative
prose is frequently interspersed with poetry, and in both
the use of dialogue is a prominent feature. Nor is the subject
matter dissimilar. Indeed it is possible to apply to the Irish
stories a classification roughly similar to that which is
adopted for the more important of the Icelandic sagas.<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
As far as the “stories of the kings” are concerned, the
resemblance is most striking in the case of sagas relating
to early times such as <i>Ynglinga Saga</i>. There are Irish
stories, too, corresponding to a certain extent to the
<i>Íslendínga Sögur</i>, though they are comparatively few in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
number, while many of the <i>Fornaldar Sögur</i> may be said
to bear a certain resemblance to the Irish epic stories.</p>

<p>The evidence discussed above seems to afford some ground
for suspecting that the saga literature of Iceland and
Ireland may not be wholly unconnected, and, as we have
seen, the conditions of the time, particularly the frequent
intercourse between the two countries, were such as to
favour the exercise of literary influence by one people upon
the other. If so, one can hardly doubt that in this case the
influence came to Iceland from Ireland.</p>

<p>We have seen<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> that the prose saga appears to have
developed in Iceland in the course of the tenth century.
There are indeed narratives relating both to the settlement
of Iceland and to still earlier events in Norway. But these,
in so far as they can be regarded as trustworthy traditions&mdash;not
embellished by fiction in later times&mdash;are quite brief,
and not far removed from such local or family traditions
as one could find in other parts of the world. The detailed
and elaborate type of story which we dealt with in Section I.,
and which is the distinctive feature of Icelandic literature,
can hardly be traced back beyond the end of the tenth
century.</p>

<p>The prose stories of Ireland, on the other hand, are without
doubt much earlier. Although we have few MSS. of Irish
prose dating from a period before the twelfth century,
yet it is generally agreed that many of the forms preserved,
<i>e.g.</i>, in the <i>Yellow Book of Lecan</i> MS. of the Tain Bo Cualnge
must be derived from an earlier MS. of not later than the
seventh or early eighth century. The oral saga in Ireland
is therefore of great antiquity.</p>

<p>It may, of course, be argued that if the prose saga arose
spontaneously in Ireland, there is no reason why it should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
not also have arisen independently in Iceland. But the
existence of this form of literature in Ireland may be due
to special circumstances for which Iceland offers no parallel.
The oldest Irish sagas belong to that class of literature
known as the heroic epic, a class which among the Teutonic
peoples&mdash;as indeed among all other European peoples&mdash;makes
its first appearance in verse. The exceptional treatment
of this subject in Irish is all the more remarkable in
view of the fact that among the Celtic peoples the <i>file</i> or
professional minstrel occupied a distinguished position in
society. It would be strange if the professional minstrel were
not primarily concerned with heroic epic poetry in Ireland
as in other countries, since in the times to which our records
refer the recitation of the heroic prose epics was one of the
chief functions of the <i>file</i>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we know nothing of the ancient forms
of Irish poetry. The earliest poems that have come down to
us have a metrical form which is not native. Earlier than
these&mdash;in the fifth and sixth centuries&mdash;there is evidence
for the cultivation of “rhetorics,” or metrical prose, but
this too appears to be of foreign origin.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> The unique feature
in Irish literature, namely, the fact that the early epic, as
it has come down to us, appears in prose instead of poetry
may be due, at least in part, to the disappearance of native
metrical forms before the fifth century. It may be that the
prose epics originated in paraphrases of early poems such
as we find, for instance, in the <i>Völsunga Saga</i>, which is a
paraphrase of older poems dealing with the story of Sigurthr.
Or the change may have been more automatic, the outcome
of a process of metrical dissolution similar to that of which
the beginnings may be seen in certain Anglo-Saxon and
German poems. Such metrical dissolution would be favoured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
if not necessitated, by the extensive phonetic changes
which took place in Ireland in the fifth century. But into
this question it is not necessary to enter here. It is sufficient
to point out that Irish Saga literature, according to all
appearances, began in the heroic epic, a form which in all
other literatures, including Norse, originated in poetry.</p>

<p>The preservation of poetry, narrative or other, by oral
tradition is a common enough phenomenon among many
peoples, but the traditional prose narrative, except in such
primitive forms as folk-tales, is very rare. Since we find
it both in Ireland and Iceland&mdash;and apparently in no other
European countries&mdash;and since we have found so many
other connections between these two countries, the theory
that the Icelandic Saga owes its origin, however indirectly,
to the Irish Saga, seems to deserve more serious consideration
from scholars than it has yet received.</p>

Literatur</i>. Strassburg, 1904, p. 830) that many of
Saxo’s stories came from Norway, where they had been collected
by an Icelander in the twelfth century. There can be no doubt that
stories of some kind relating to families and localities&mdash;especially
stories which accounted, or professed to account for local names&mdash;were
current in Norway down to this time. Such stories form the
basis of many of the <i>Fornaldar Sögur</i>, but in all probability these had
been familiar to Icelanders from the first settlement of the island,
or at least during the tenth century. We have no evidence that they
ever gained literary form in Norway. (Cf. Finnur Jónsson: <i>Old

There is a possible reference to an Irish story-teller in an inscription
on a stone cross at Bridgend (Glamorganshire). The inscription,
which is thought to date from the seventh century, runs:&mdash;<i>(Co)nbellini
possuit hanc crucem pro anima eius Scitliuissi</i> … Rhys takes
<i>scitlivissi</i> to be an Irish word, a compound of <i>viss</i> (Ir. <i>fis</i>, ‘knowledge’)
and <i>scitl</i> (<i>scetlon</i>, <i>scél</i>, a ‘story,’ ‘news’) and surmises that
<i>scitliviss</i> might mean a ‘messenger,’ a ‘bringer of news,’ a ‘scout.’
(Cf. <i>Celtic Britain</i>, pp. 313-315.) But <i>scitliviss</i> can also be explained
as ‘one who knows stories.’ In that case we might infer that story-telling
was a profession in Ireland as early as the seventh century;
but the reading appears to be too uncertain to justify us in attaching
any great importance to the inscription.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
